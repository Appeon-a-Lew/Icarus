Outline:


Introduction:
  Multiprocessor, Many core systems etc <- need for scheduling 
  Work stealing and work sharing <- types of solutions 
    Deques 
      open/share half/private 
      syncron and asyncron versions 
    morsels 
      NUMA, affinity etc 
  Introduce my approach:
    Mailboxing 
      dual scheduling <- how mailboxing works overview
      morsel based parallelism <- cache affinity 
      state of the art work stealing 
        all combined 
    Goal: lowest scheduling latency
