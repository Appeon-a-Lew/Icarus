# Bachelor-Arbeit

## Description
Repository for my bachelor thesis, containing the development, and improvement of morsel based scheduler.

## Installation
As of 18.05 you can only do an empty task test of the schedulers under src/comparison using run.sh.
The writing part is contained in thesis/build.

## Roadmap
Until next meeting: 
    using perf understand why oneapi is significantly slower.
    find a meaningful way to measure per task latency.
    read up on literature.
