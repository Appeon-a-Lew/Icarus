Work Stealing is provably efficient for multithreading and multi programmed systems. This 
work expands on the complexity of scheduling and puts forward a tiered scheduling schema. 
The concept of mailboxing, or more generally work sharing, is well researched. In this 
work,it is our aim to combine the strengths of both work sharing and work stealing to 
achieve low latency scheduling. 
Our preliminary results show a two tiered scheduling has lower latency than a pure 
work stealing scheduler. An initial work sharing phase reduces the start times of the 
tasks. After this phase work stealing is used to balance the load between threads. 
Furthermore, we examine the effects of different concurrent deque algorithms. Private,
share-half, ABP \cite{ABP} and dynamic deque conceptualized by Chase-Lev\cite{chase-lev}. 
While mailboxing improved the general latency, work sharing has worse cache performance\cite{cache}. 
To solve this, we employed morsels\cite{morsels}. This improved the overall performance as well as the 
cache affinity of our scheduler.
