This thesis improves parallel query execution by enhancing a scheduler based on the morsel-driven framework to effectively utilize the capabilities of modern many-core processors, with a specific focus on NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) challenges. The growing  decentralization of memory controllers in many-core systems complicates  efficient data access and task scheduling, necessitating new approaches to maintain high performance and scalability. The enhanced  scheduler dynamically assigns small data fragments, or morsels, to  worker threads, adjusting in real-time to changes in data access speeds  and task demands. This approach directly addresses NUMA-related issues  by optimizing data locality and minimizing unnecessary data movement  across different memory nodes,  thus achieving elasticity. Extensive  benchmarks, including comparisons with other multithreading schedulers like oneAPI  and OpenMP, demonstrate the scheduler's effectiveness, especially in small and big tasks.
